# Circuit Simulator

The report for this project is available [here](Circuit Simulator Report.pdf)


## Overview

The following repository contains a Circuit Simulator written in C++ which can perform steady state and transient analysis on circuits with linear components and one non-linear component: diodes. Similar to LTSpice, it conducts nodal analysis in order to output a list of nodal voltages and branch currents across each timestep, in order to show the analysis of the circuit.

In order to run the simulator, the following steps can be taken as shown below:

Run the build_simulator.sh file to build the old simulator

Run the build_simulator_improved.sh file to build the new simulator

This can be used to see improvements made across the 2 versions

All the complex tests used in the report are stored in the "final_tests" folder

All the tests used during coding to make sure the code compiles and runs at the basic level are stored in the "preliminary_tests" folder
